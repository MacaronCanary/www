    <h1>History - National Security Letter (NSL)</h1>
    <p>A National Security Letter (NSL) is an administrative subpoena issued to bypass the judicial system, "used to obtain information from companies as part of national security investigations" (<cite>EFF</cite>).</p>
    <p>The FBI, through NSLs, issue broad requests for information on targets including "communities of interest" that enables them to request information to expand mass surveillance and data collection on targets twice, or even further removed from the original target.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>Quick NSL 101</h2>
        <h3>Is this a warrant?</h3>
        <p>No, a NSL is a subpoena. The FBI deliberately confuses recipients on this by using vague language and wording in a threatening manner. If you have received one please speak to your attorney.</p>
        <h3>Who is authorised to issue a NSL?</h3>
        <p>Various government agencies, but the vast majority of NSLs are issued by the FBI as a statute allows the FBI Director, Deputy Assistant Director, and all FBI Special Agents in Charge of FBI field offices, to be authorised to issue NSLs.</p>
        <h3>What can be requested?</h3>
        <p>Non-content information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>Transaction Records (date, time, length of calls</li>
            <li>Length of Service</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What about metadata? Or "Electronic Communication Transaction Records"?</h3>
        <p>Metadata is data.</p>
        <p>In 2008, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/06/23/op-olc-v032-p0145.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) at the US Justice Department</a> clarified that the FBI is not authorised to issue NSLs requesting Electronic Communication Transactional Records (ECTR) such as e-mails.</p>
        <p>The FBI, however, disregarded the guidance and deliberately continues to serve NSLs requesting a vague "Electronic Communication Transaction Records" request. This is done in an effort to mislead and hope recipients of a NSL will provide further information without the necessity of a court order approved by a judge.</p>
        <p>Electronic Communication Transactional Records (ECTR) as defined in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">18 U.S.C 2709</a> by Congress (1993) purposely limited the scope of records that could be requested with a NSL. Moreover, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">18 U.S.C 2703(d)</a> requires for any criminial investigation a court order for ECTRs which "shall issue only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation."</p>

        <h2>NSL Timeline</h2>
        <h3>1978</h3>
        <h4>The first provisional NSL was created.</h4>
        <p>Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA), as part of the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978, the NSL was to be used as an investigative tool for terrorism and espionage investigations for financial records, but was used sparingly as the FBI had to show beforehand that their target was a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power before they could obtain records.</p>
        <p>Penalties did not exist for lack of compliance, as the NSL recipient’s actions after receiving one were voluntary. In addition, various states’ consumer privacy laws allowed recipients to outright reject the NSL.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>1986</h3>
        <h4>RFPA amended.</h4>
        <p>The government could now request disclosure of information for NSLs.</p>
        <h4>Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) passed by Congress.</h4>
        <p>The ECPA in the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. 2709, allowed the FBI to issue NSLs. Penalities still did not exist for lack of compliance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>1993</h3>
        <h4>Amendment removed NSL restrictions on targets, allowed NSLs to be used as a way to request information from persons other than the direct target(s).</h4>
        <p>A restriction of requiring targets be a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power was removed, and in a historic move additionally now allowed NSLs to be used as a way to request information on people not directly the subject(s) of an investigation.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>2000</h3>
        <h4>Fact: 8500 NSLs were issued that year.</h4>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>2001</h3>
        <h4>26 October: USA PATRIOT Act (2001) signed into law.</h4>
        <p>President George W. Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which combined several acts (e.g. RFPA, ECPA) into one, and in section 505 loosening the standards for issuing NSLs. The USA PATRIOT Act now allowed sending a NSL to banks, libraries, telephone and internet companies; and allowed NSLs to be issued by not only just the Director or Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI but additionally all FBI Special Agents in Charge of any field office.</p>
        <p>The right to counsel was not made explicit and the statute barred recipients from disclosing what they were demanded of.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>2004</h3>
        <h4>Fact: 56,507 NSLs were issued that year.</h4>
        <p>In a dramatic increase from prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, every NSL was additionally accompanied by a categorical and permanent gag order.</p>
        <h4>April: Doe v. Ashcroft (2004) was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of an anonymous ISP owner in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, finally revealed as Nicholas Merrill of Calyx Internet Access in 2010.</h4>
        <h4>28 September: District Court rules NSL statute is unconstitutional under the First and Fourth amendments.</h4>

        <h4><a href="https://www.congress.gov/109/plaws/publ177/PLAW-109publ177.pdf">USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005</a></h4>
        <p>Section 505 was substantially amended enough that in Doe v Gonzales (23 May 2006) on the Act: "However, while this appeal was pending, Congress passed the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-177, 120 Stat. 192 (Mar. 9, 2006) (the “Reauthorization Act” or the “Act”). This Act dramatically altered § 2709, and added several new procedures codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3511, which now govern judicial review of the FBI's requests for information through NSLs.</p>

        <p>In addition to the Reauthorization Act of 2005, with the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, Congress once again amended 18 U.S.C. 2709, addressing some of the concerns detailed previously in the district court decision, whether improving (e.g. limited judicial review of a NSL if recipient files a legal challenge contesting the NSL, confirming the right "to obtain legal advice or legal assistance with respect to the request") or worsening them (e.g. gag order provisions were significantly worsened with a penalty of up to 5 years for failure to comply with the non-disclosure).</p>

        <p>Doe v Gonzales (2006) consolidated both the Doe v Ashcroft (NY, 2004) and Doe v Gonzales (CT, 2005) cases. Due to "the Reauthorization Act’s provisions apply retroactively to NSLs issued before the Reauthorization Act", the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded the first Doe v Gonzales (originally Doe v Ashcroft 2004) case back to the district court in NY, dismissing the second Doe v Gonzales case as the government had conceded to allowing the librarians to reveal their identities.</p>

        <h3>2007</h3>
        <h4>6 September: <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/nsldecision.pdf">Doe v Gonzales</a>, District Court struck down entirety of the NSL provisions under the USA PATRIOT Act [again]</h4>
        <p>With Doe v Gonzales, previously Doe v Ashcroft (2004), back to the district court the ACLU and New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) successfully argued Congress had not addressed all of the deficiencies in their amended statutes.</p>
        <p>Judge Victor Marrero once again struck down the entirety of the NSL provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act, as "the Court concludes that § 2709 (c) is unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it functions as a licensing scheme that doe snot afford adequate procedural safeguards, and because it is not a sufficiently narrowly tailored restriction on protected speech. Because the Court finds that § 2709(c) cannot be severed from the remainder of the statute, the Court finds the entirety of § 2709 unconstitutional. Additionally, the Court concludes that § 3511 (b) is unconstitutional under the First Amendment and the doctrine of separation of powers."</p>

        <h4>15 December: <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/doevmukasey_decision.pdf">Doe v Mukasey</a>, appeals court upholds and affirms most of the district court's September 2007 decision</h4>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision which "affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion" on the September 2007 district court decision in Doe v Mukasey, previously Doe v Ashcroft (2004), invalidating a few parts of the gag-order scheme, ruled that "subsections 2709(c) and 3511(b) are unconstitutional to the extent that they impose a nondisclosure requirement on NSL recipients without placing on the Government the burden of initiating judicial review of such a requirement", additionally requiring that the FBI needed to prove that disclosure of the NSL would harm national security cases.</p>

        <p>In the settlement of Doe v Holder, previously Doe v Ashcroft (2004), the FBI partially lifted the gag order revealing the ACLU's client, Nicholas Merrill, and thus became the first recipient of a NSL to challenge the demands for records.</p>

        <h3>2013</h3>
        <h4>Fact: ~60 NSLs issued daily.</h4>
        <p>President Barack Obama's Intelligence Review Group reported that on average nearly 60 NSLs were issued daily.</p>
        <h4>February: Cloudflare served <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4XtysvKJwSAR2hNaDVSaDZIWjA/view">NSL-12-358696</a></h4>
        <p>Cloudflare objected to the NSL. With the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) agreeing to take on the case, a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2017/01/09/16-16082_dkt_66.pdf">legal challenge began under seal.</a></p>
        <h4>July: FBI rescinded Cloudflare's NSL and withdrew their request for information but left the gag order in place.</h4>
        <p>With the gag order remaining, Cloudflare was unable to update their transparency reports to disclose receiving a NSL.</p>

        <h3>2014</h3>
        <h4>Ken Carter of Cloudflare meets with Capitol Hill staffer who dismisses NSL concerns.</h4>
        <p>As best detailed by Ken Carter in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-transparency-report-for-second-half-2016-and-an-additional-disclosure-for-2013-2/">Cloudflare's additional disclosure for 2013 in January 2017</a>: "In early 2014, I met with a key Capitol Hill staffer who worked on issues related to counter-terrorism, homeland security, and the judiciary. I had a conversation where I explained how Cloudflare values transparency, due process of law, and expressed concerns that NSLs are unconstitutional tools of convenience rather than necessity. The staffer dismissed my concerns and expressed that Cloudflare’s position on NSLs was a product of needless worrying, speculation, and misinformation."</p>
        <p>Notably as Carter detailed, "The staffer noted it would be impossible for an NSL to issue against Cloudflare, since the services our company provides expressly did not fall within the jurisdiction of the NSL statute. The staffer went so far as to open a copy of the U.S. Code and read from the statutory language to make her point."</p>

        <h3>2017</h3>
        <h4>Cloudflare finally reveals and discloses receiving a NSL in 2013.</h4>
        <p>In their <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-transparency-report-for-second-half-2016-and-an-additional-disclosure-for-2013-2/">blog post</a> announcing their Transparency Report for Second Half of 2016, they additionally revealed the previously undisclosed NSL received in 2013, addressing concerns on customer data, detailing the legal process they underwent, and provided legal documents pertaining to the NSL. Ken Carter made several strong points including: Cloudflare should not and does not fall under the NSL statute jurisdiction for providers; that the NSL was rescinded without any disclosure of information pursuant to that NSL just months after issuance, both implications that the FBI is issuing NSLs to providers that are clearly out of legal scope in the hopes a provider will provide the information requested in the NSL, a subpoena, without a court order approved by a judge for electronic communication transactional records (ECTR).</p>
